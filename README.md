# Flowchart Builder

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Flowchart Builder is an interactive web application that allows users to create, modify, and manage flowcharts dynamically. The app uses **React Flow** to render draggable nodes and edges, with data persistence handled via **localStorage**. Users can create nodes, connect them via edges, delete elements, and download the current flowchart as a JSON file.
